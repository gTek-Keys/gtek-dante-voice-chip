# Generate an encryption key
ENCRYPTION_KEY=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
echo "Your encryption key: $ENCRYPTION_KEY"

# Add to Vercel dashboard:
# ENCRYPTION_KEY = [the generated key above]
# OPENAI_API_KEY = [your OpenAI API key for voice features]
# VOICE_MODEL = gpt-4-turbo-preview
```

#### 2. Complete Local Agent Installation
```bash
cd agent
./install.sh  # This will now work properly
./start.sh    # Start monitoring your terminal
```
